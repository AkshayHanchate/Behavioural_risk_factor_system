Overview
This project involves the real-time data ingestion, processing, and analysis of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. The BRFSS is a large dataset focusing on public health risk factors. The goal of this project is to implement real-time data processing pipelines, develop predictive machine learning models, and deploy MLOps practices to automate and monitor these models. The data visualization will be performed using Power BI.

Key Components
1. Real-Time Data Processing
We ingest real-time data from multiple platforms, including:

On-prem systems (e.g., CSV files stored locally and streamed to the cloud)
APIs (e.g., RESTful APIs that provide real-time data feeds)
Cloud platforms (e.g., Google Cloud Storage)

2. Machine Learning Models
We are developing several machine learning models based on the BRFSS dataset. These models focus on predicting health risks and identifying behavioral patterns. The following models will be part of this project:

a. Stroke Prediction Model:
Predicts the likelihood of an individual suffering from a stroke based on factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and exercise habits.
b. Heart Disease Prediction Model:
Predicts the probability of developing heart disease using features like cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle behaviors.
c. Diabetes Prediction Model:
Identifies individuals at risk for Type 2 diabetes based on factors such as BMI, physical activity, and diet.
d. Mental Health Risk Prediction:
Assesses the likelihood of experiencing anxiety or depression based on socioeconomic and behavioral factors.
e. Smoking Cessation Prediction:
Predicts whether individuals are likely to quit smoking based on their current habits, demographics, and healthcare support.


3. MLOps Implementation
This project implements MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) to automate the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of machine learning models in production. The MLOps pipeline ensures that real-time data is continuously fed into the models, predictions are updated, and model performance is monitored.

MLOps Features:
Automated model retraining based on updated real-time data
Model performance monitoring (accuracy, precision, recall)
Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for deploying models
Error handling and logging to track model performance over time


4. Data Visualization using Power BI
Once the data has been processed and the models have been deployed, the results will be visualized using Power BI. The dashboards will provide insights into public health risk factors, showing predictions for chronic diseases, mental health, and other behavioral risks.

Features:
Health risk dashboards: Visualize model predictions for stroke, diabetes, heart disease, and smoking cessation.
Trend analysis: Show patterns in public health risk factors over time based on real-time data feeds.
Interactive reports: Allow users to explore different variables and predictions interactively.
